#It's simpler than this: xy = n!(x+y), so (x - n!)(y - n!) = (n!)^2. 
#So each positive divisor d of (n!)^2 gives a solution x = d + n!, y = n!^2/d + n!,
#and each solution arises this way. Which, as the OP already observed, 
#reduces it to the problem of counting divisors of (n!)^2
#so no of factors in n!^2
